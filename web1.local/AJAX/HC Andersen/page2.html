<h2>Early life</h2><p>Hans Christian Andersen was born in the town of Odense, Denmark, on Tuesday, April 2, 1805. He was an only child. Andersen's father, also Hans, considered himself related to nobility. His paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had in the past belonged to a higher social class, but investigations prove these stories unfounded. Theories that Andersen may have been an illegitimate son of King Christian VII persist. Nevertheless, King Frederick VI took a personal interest in him as a youth and paid for a part of his education.</p><p>Andersen's father, who had received an elementary education, introduced Andersen to literature, reading him Arabian Nights. Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was educated and worked as a lawyer following his father's death in 1816, remarrying in 1818. Andersen was sent to a boarding school for rich children where he received an advanced education and was forced to support himself, working as a banker and, later, for a doctor. At 14, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.</p>
